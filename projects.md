# Hardware Design of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
*Aug ’20 – Jan ‘21* <br>
[Project Webpage](https://alsarmie.github.io/DD2414-Documentation/) <br>

 * Designed and built a serviceable research drone platform tailored towards indoor navigation and visual SLAM
 * Integrated sensors, including lidar cameras, with flight control unit (PX4) and companion computer (MAVROS)
 * Manufactured modular components for simplified construction and easily configurable sensor payloads

# Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
*Jan ’20 – Dec ‘20* <br>
[Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qWFHkYBH9ujdldfnacRQuP8OoNJ60fOj/view?usp=sharing) <br>

 * Built a multithreaded Particle Filter API enabling co-researchers to prototype various AUV sensor configurations
 * Researched optimal usage of MBES sonar data for TRN, including feature matching and gaussian processes


# Comprehensive Robotic System for an Autonomous Micro Air Vehicle (MAV)
*Jan ’20 – May ‘20* <br>
[Project Repository](https://github.com/Hackerman342/crazyflie_9)

 * Developed and integrated perception, localization, planning, and motion control for an autonomous MAV
 * Built computer vision perception and localization systems using deep learning detection of traffic signs in real-time
